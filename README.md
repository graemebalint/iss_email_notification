# iss_email_notification

This program uses the smtplib and requests libraries to send you an email notificaiton when the International Space Station is within 5 points of your longtitude and latitude coorindates.

**Instructions:**

1. This program is a little difficult to test immediately, since it only sends an email when the ISS coordinates returned by the API are close to yours. To test whether the email engine is working properly, feel free to set your longitude and latitude coordinates to within 5 points of the ISS. 

**Project goals:**

1. Practice with fetching publicly available data using API calls.
2. Use Python to send an automated email.
